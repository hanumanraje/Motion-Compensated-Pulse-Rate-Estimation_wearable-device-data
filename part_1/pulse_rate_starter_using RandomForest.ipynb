    "\n",
    "Answer the following prompts to demonstrate understanding of the algorithm you wrote for this specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Code Description** - The Evaluate function will load the dataset, calculate pulse rate using RunPulseRateAlgorithm function and finally give confidence interval for each given heart rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Data Description** -\n",
    "1. The data contains two-channel PPG signals, three-axis acceleration signals, and one-channel ECG signals from subjects with age >from 18 to 35.\n",
    "2. The data is sampled at 125Hz from 12 different subjects\n",
    "3. The data provides ground-truth heart rate (in BPM) in every 8-second time window with overlap of 6 seconds with two successive time windows .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Algorithhm Description** \n",
    "1. The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "  1. Perform bandpass filter on PPG and Accelerometer Magnitude signal.\n",
    "  2. Use plt.specgram function to get FFT and freqs in a window of 8 seconds with an overlap of 6 seconds.\n",
    "  3. Now calculate estimate pulse rate by iterating in each window\n",
    "    1. Find dominant frequencies from PPG and accelerometer magnitude signal.\n",
    "    2. If both the dominant frequencies don't match, then take this as the estimated pulse rate from this window.\n",
    "    3. If both of them match, then further check the next strongest PPG frequencies if there is another good candidate.\n",
    "  4. Now calculate the MAE between reference pulse rate and estimated pulse rate.\n",
    "  5. Confidence is estimated by summing the frequency spectrum near the pulse rate estimate and dividing it by the sum of the entire spectrum.\n",
    "  6. The algorithm generates pulse rate estimates and confidence every 2s.\n",
    "2. The specific aspects of the physiology that it takes advantage of:\n",
    "  1. We use PPG signals for measuring heart rate.\n",
    "  1. The capillaries in the wrist are filled with blood when the ventricles contract.\n",
    "  1. When there are few red blood cells in these capillaries, the light from the PPG sensor will be reflected in a large amount.\n",
    "  1. When the blood cells are many, they absorb the light, so the optical detector will detect less light.\n",
    "  1. Changes in the light detected by the optical detector, will produce an oscillating waveform which is the pulse rate.\n",
    "3. Now calculate the MAE between reference pulse rate and estimated pulse rate.\n",
    "4. Confidence is estimated by summing the frequency spectrum near the pulse rate estimate and dividing it by the sum of the entire spectrum.\n",
    "5. The algorithm generates pulse rate estimates and confidence every 2s.\n",
    "6. The specific aspects of the physiology that it takes advantage of:\n",
    "  1. We use PPG signals for measuring heart rate.\n",

    "  5. Changes in the light detected by the optical detector, will produce an oscillating waveform which is the pulse rate.\n",
    "7. A description of the algorithm outputs: The algorithm calculates estimated pulse rate (in BPM) along with confidence estimates. A higher confidence value means that this estimate should be more accurate than an estimate with a lower confidence value.\n",
    "8. Caveats on algorithm outputs: The algorithm can be affected by noise through other sources.\n",
    "9. Common failure modes: The algorithm may be affected by arm and finger motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - **Algorithm Performance** \n",
    "1. The performance is calculated using MAE between reference pulse rate and estimated pulse rate.\n",
    "2. The other metrics such as Precision, Recall and F1-score can also be computed.\n",
    "3. The MAE obtained on the test data is 12.5."
